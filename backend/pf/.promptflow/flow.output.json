    "- The prosecution argued that the appellant killed the deceased with murderous intent and that there was no evidence of provocation or diminished responsibility.": "From the comments made by the appellant’s leading counsel, Mr Andrew Bruce SC, to the judge on the draft directions, it is clear that on the issue of provocation, the only concern leading counsel had was in respect of factual provoking conduct, and the expert evidence on the appellant’s mental health was seen as relevant to the special characteristics of the appellant in considering the “do as he did” element of provocation only.",
    "- The defense argued that the appellant was provoked by the deceased's infidelity and that he lost control of his actions due to his mental health issues. ": "On appeal, Mr Bruce, for the appellant, successfully ran the argument that the judge misdirected the jury by failing to draw their attention to the psychiatric evidence and its relevance in relation to the issue of whether the appellant lost or might have lost his self‑control[7].",
    "- The appellant pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of provocation": "He again pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of provocation which was not accepted by the prosecution.",
    "- Whether the trial judge misdirected the jury by failing to draw their attention to the psychiatric evidence regarding the appellant's mental state and its relevance to the issue of whether he lost control.": "On appeal, Mr Bruce, for the appellant, successfully ran the argument that the judge misdirected the jury by failing to draw their attention to the psychiatric evidence and its relevance in relation to the issue of whether the appellant lost or might have lost his self‑control[7].",
    "- The Court of Appeal held that the psychiatric evidence was \"highly relevant\" to the factual issue of loss of self-control and that the trial judge's failure to direct the jury on this issue resulted in the defense of provocation not being fully and fairly placed before the jury.": "The Court of Appeal unanimously agreed that the psychiatric evidence was “highly relevant”[8] to the factual issue of loss of self‑control, and concluded that the judge’s “clear failure”[9] to direct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to this issue resulted in the defence of provocation not being fully and fairly placed before the jury.",
    "- The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction for the third time. ": "On each occasion, the conviction was overturned on appeal – twice by the Court of Appeal[1] and once by this Court[2] (reversing the Court of Appeal’s dismissal of the appellant’s application for leave to appeal[3]) – and a retrial was ordered.",
    "- The Court of Appeal ordered a third retrial, but the Court of Final Appeal granted leave to appeal against the order for retrial.": "On 29 March 2021, the Appeal Committee (Ribeiro PJ, Fok PJ and Tang NPJ) granted leave to appeal on the substantial and grave injustice basis on the footing that it was reasonably arguable that in ordering a third retrial for murder, the exercise of discretion by the majority of the Court of Appeal miscarried.",
    "- The appellant was convicted of murder three times, but each conviction was overturned on appeal due to errors in the trial process.": "On each occasion, the conviction was overturned on appeal – twice by the Court of Appeal[1] and once by this Court[2] (reversing the Court of Appeal’s dismissal of the appellant’s application for leave to appeal[3]) – and a retrial was ordered.",
    "- The Court of Appeal ordered a third retrial.": "On 29 March 2021, the Appeal Committee (Ribeiro PJ, Fok PJ and Tang NPJ) granted leave to appeal on the substantial and grave injustice basis on the footing that it was reasonably arguable that in ordering a third retrial for murder, the exercise of discretion by the majority of the Court of Appeal miscarried.",
    "- The Court of Final Appeal allowed the appeal against the order for retrial and quashed the conviction, holding that a third retrial would be oppressive to the appellant and that the interests of justice did not require it.": "Section 83E(1) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance provides that the Court of Appeal may order a retrial “if it appears to the Court of Appeal that the interests of justice so require”.",
    "- The Court of Final Appeal entered a conviction for manslaughter on the basis of provocation and sentenced the appellant to time served, allowing for his immediate release from custody.": "Rather, a conviction for manslaughter on the basis of provocation should be entered on the appellant’s plea of guilty and the appellant sentenced accordingly, thereby bringing finality and closure to this tragic case.",
    "- The discretion to order a retrial is put in the widest possible terms and depends entirely on what justice requires.": "This discretion is usually exercised, as it should be, by the Court of Appeal, relying on their ‘collective sense of justice and common sense.’[37] And, as was put by Lord Bingham of Cornhill, there must be ‘an informed and dispassionate assessment of how the interests of justice in the widest sense are best served’; it is important to maintain ‘confidence in the efficacy of the criminal justice system.’[38]\n\n(2)   The discretion whether or not to order a retrial depends entirely on what justice requires (this being the ‘critical question’).",
    "- The interests of justice include a consideration of an accused’s interests and circumstances, as well as the interest of the public in seeing those who are guilty of serious crimes brought to justice.": "[41] The interests of justice also include the interest of the public in seeing those who are guilty of serious crimes brought to justice and not escape merely because of a technical error in the conduct of a trial or in the summing up to a jury.",
    "- The interests of justice require all relevant factors, both for and against a retrial, to be taken into account, including the fact that the accused has already undergone a trial, particularly where the trial is long and complex.": "[46]\n\n(5)   The above said, one factor that must be given significant weight is the fact that the accused has already undergone a trial, in particular where the trial is long and complex.",
    "- The prosecution case for murder must be strong and the strength of the prosecution case is a relevant consideration in exercising the discretion to order a retrial. ": "I give due weight to the view of the prosecution as representing the public interest that although this case is testing the limits of the discretion to order a retrial, the public interest inclines in favour of a fourth trial.",
    "- In this case, the appellant’s story, the circumstances under which the killing took place and the psychiatric evidence all supported a manslaughter verdict, making the murder verdict not a foregone conclusion. ": "On the facts and evidence before us, I would say that the defence of provocation, which is supported by the appellant’s story (which to some extent is corroborated by the deceased’s former husband’s evidence), the circumstances under which the killing took place and the psychiatric evidence, is at least reasonably arguable and a murder verdict is certainly not a foregone conclusion.",
    "- The primary responsibility for exercising the discretion to order a retrial lies with the Court of Appeal.": "As already mentioned, the primary responsibility for exercising the discretion to order a retrial lies with the Court of Appeal, after quashing a conviction below.",
    "- This Court would only intervene in limited circumstances, such as where there has been a serious error of law or principle or approach.": "As explained in Zhou Limei (No 2)[53], this Court would only intervene in limited circumstances:\n\n“ In common with the review of discretion in other areas, this Court will not disturb the exercise of discretion by the Court of Appeal in the determination whether or not to order a retrial unless there has been a serious error of law or principle or approach, such as where the court below has failed to take into account a relevant consideration or has taken into account an irrelevant one.",
    "- The appellant had already undergone three trials and numerous appeals over 11 years.": "\n(i)  on the assumption that the applicant was awarded a discount of one third for his offer to plead guilty to manslaughter[20] then the applicant has, in effect, already served a fixed term sentence of approximately 23 years’ imprisonment[21];\n\n(ii)  the applicant has been forced to undergo the ordeal of three trials and multiple appeals over the course of 11 years and as a consequence a fourth trial to determine whether he is guilty of murder, as opposed to manslaughter, would be oppressive to him;\n\n\n4.",
    "- The appellant had been remanded in custody for almost twelve years.": "Secondly, the appellant has already been remanded in custody for almost twelve years.",
    "- The appellant had offered to plead guilty to manslaughter from the beginning and had spent more time in custody than the sentence he would have received if convicted of manslaughter.": "Mr Tam, Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, very fairly accepted that bearing in mind the one‑third discount for the early plea of guilty and the one‑third remission for good behaviour by the Commissioner of Correctional Services, the time that the appellant had spent in custody would have exceeded whatever sentence that this Court might legitimately pass in the present case on the basis of a manslaughter conviction.",
    "- The prosecution case for murder was not particularly strong, as there was evidence to support a verdict of manslaughter.": "I note that in R v Bell the English Court of Appeal said of a third trial for murder:\n\n‘The broad public interest in the administration of criminal justice leads us to the clear view that a second re‑trial should be confined to the very small number of cases in which the jury is being invited to address a crime of extreme gravity which has undoubtedly occurred (as here) and in which the evidence that the defendant committed the crime (again, as here) on any fair minded objective judgment remains very powerful.’[22]\n\nI am not persuaded that it can be said that on a fair minded objective judgment, the evidence ‘remains very powerful’ for the return of a verdict of murder, as opposed to a verdict of manslaughter.”[23]\n(4)  The seriousness of the offence and the strength of the case.",
    "- The appellant's mental health issues and the failure of the trial judge to properly instruct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence contributed to the miscarriage of justice.": "The Court of Appeal unanimously agreed that the psychiatric evidence was “highly relevant”[8] to the factual issue of loss of self‑control, and concluded that the judge’s “clear failure”[9] to direct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to this issue resulted in the defence of provocation not being fully and fairly placed before the jury.",
    "- This case provides guidance on the exercise of discretion in ordering a retrial, particularly in cases where the accused has already undergone multiple trials and appeals.": "The printed cases of the parties referred to a number of cases in which the courts considered how the discretion to order a retrial should be exercised[52].",
    "- It also highlights the importance of considering the strength of the prosecution case and the interests of the appellant, including the time they have already spent in custody.": "Such factors will not only vary from case to case, but their relative importance and weight will also be different in any given case."
