    "- Testimony from the victim's ex-husband that the deceased called him on the morning of the murder and told him that the appellant had gone crazy, taken off all his clothing, and attempted to jump off the building.": "According to the deceased’s ex‑husband, the deceased had called him on his mobile at 5:40 am and told him that the appellant had gone crazy, taken off all his clothing and attempted to jump off the building, and she was scared.",

    "- The interests of justice.": "This discretion is usually exercised, as it should be, by the Court of Appeal, relying on their ‘collective sense of justice and common sense.’[37] And, as was put by Lord Bingham of Cornhill, there must be ‘an informed and dispassionate assessment of how the interests of justice in the widest sense are best served’; it is important to maintain ‘confidence in the efficacy of the criminal justice system.’[38]",
    "- The interests of the accused.": "[39]\n\n(3)   The interests of justice of course include a consideration of an accused’s interests and circumstances.",
    "- The interests of the public.": "In assessing the public interest, a court must take into account the views of the prosecution which is best qualified (and I would add has the duty) to present the views of the public,[45]although it must ultimately be for the court to determine what is in the public interest.",

    "- Each conviction was overturned on appeal due to errors made during the trial.": "On 30 October 2013, the Court of Appeal allowed his appeal and quashed the conviction because impermissible hearsay evidence was adduced at trial, with no objection from defence counsel who somehow considered it advantageous to his case.",
