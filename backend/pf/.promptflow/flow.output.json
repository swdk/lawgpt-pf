    "- Liang was sentenced to time served and released from custody.": "Mr Tam, Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, very fairly accepted that bearing in mind the one‑third discount for the early plea of guilty and the one‑third remission for good behaviour by the Commissioner of Correctional Services, the time that the appellant had spent in custody would have exceeded whatever sentence that this Court might legitimately pass in the present case on the basis of a manslaughter conviction.",
