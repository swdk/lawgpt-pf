This discretion is usually exercised, as it should be, by the Court of Appeal, relying on their ‘collective sense of justice and common sense.’ And, as was put by Lord Bingham of Cornhill, there must be ‘an informed and dispassionate assessment of how the interests of justice in the widest sense are best served’; it is important to maintain ‘confidence in the efficacy of the criminal justice system.’ \"\"\"\n\n**Argument: The interests of justice**\n\n- Reference: Mok Kin Kau v HKSAR (2008) 11 HKCFAR 1\n- excerpts: \"\"\"It should be acknowledged that any criminal trial is to some degree an ordeal for the accused. The criminal justice system is there to bring matters to a conclusion without undue delay and without oppression; these are ‘accepted norms’. The more often the defendant has to face trial, the greater the ordeal will be for him, and the less fair the criminal justice process will be perceived to be. It goes without saying that no judge exercising his discretion judicially would require a person who had undergone this ordeal once to endure it for a second time unless the interests of justice required it.\"\"\"\n\n**Argument: The strength of the prosecution case**\n\n- Reference: HKSAR v Zhou Limei (No 2) (2020) 23 HKCFAR 169\n- excerpts: \"\"\" Although it is not unprecedented for a second retrial to be ordered, the cases accept that this is an ‘unusual’ course to take, even where the accused has not served the whole of his or her sentence as was the case in Mok Kin Kau v HKSAR. Given that the ordering of a second retrial is an unusual course, a court would have to be persuaded by cogent and compelling reasons to make such an order. This is consistent with the interests of justice, but of course all relevant factors must be carefully weighed in this exercise of discretion.\"\"\"\n\n**Argument: The lapse of time**\n\n- Reference: Ng Yuk Kin v The Crown (1955) 39 HKLR 49\n- excerpts: \"\"\" there may be cases where it ‘is in the interest of the public, the complainant, and the appellant himself that the question of guilt or otherwise be determined finally by the verdict of a jury, and not left as something which must remain undecided by reason of a defect in legal machinery’.\"\"\"\n\n**Argument: The principles governing the exercise of the statutory discretion to order a retrial**\n\n- Reference: HKSAR v Tam Ho Nam (No 2), (2017) 20 HKCFAR 414, per Fok PJ\n- excerpts: \"\"\"The discretion whether or not to order a retrial depends entirely on what justice requires (this being the ‘critical question’). The jurisdiction to order a retrial is thus put in the widest possible terms. In HKSAR v Tam Ho Nam (No 2), Fok PJ restated the relevant principles regarding retrials by reference to Au Pui Kuen v Attorney General of Hong Kong, Ting James Henry v HKSAR and Kissel v HKSAR. The following principles, distilled from the above and other cases, are relevant in the present case:\n\n(1) Whether or not a retrial should be ordered is a matter of discretion. This discretion is usually exercised, as it should be, by the Court of Appeal, relying on their ‘collective sense of justice and common sense.’ And, as was put by Lord Bingham of Cornhill, there must be ‘an informed and dispassionate assessment of how the interests of justice in the widest sense are best served’; it is important to maintain ‘confidence in the efficacy of the criminal justice system.’\n\n(2) The discretion whether or not to order a retrial depends entirely on what justice requires (this being the ‘critical question’).\n\n(3) The interests of justice of course include a consideration of an accused’s interests and circumstances. The criminal justice system is there to bring matters to a conclusion without undue delay and without oppression; these are ‘accepted norms’. It should be acknowledged that any criminal trial is to some degree an ordeal for the accused. The interests of justice also include the interest of the public in seeing those who are guilty of serious crimes brought to justice and not escape merely because of a technical error in the conduct of a trial or in the summing up to a jury.\n\n(4) The interests of justice require all relevant factors, both for and against a retrial, to be taken into account. Such factors will not only vary from case to case, but their relative importance and weight will also be different in any given case.\n\n(5) The above said, one factor that must be given significant weight is the fact that the accused has already undergone a trial, in particular where the trial is long and complex. This is all the more so when there is involved a second retrial, which means of course the possibility of a third trial for the same offence. Although it is not unprecedented for a second retrial to be ordered, the cases accept that this is an ‘unusual’ course to take, even where the accused has not served the whole of his or her sentence as was the case in Mok Kin Kau v HKSAR. Given that the ordering of a second retrial is an unusual course, a court would have to be persuaded by cogent and compelling reasons to make such an order. This is consistent with the interests of justice, but of course all relevant factors must be carefully weighed in this exercise of discretion.\n\n(6) Another factor that should also be taken into account is the time that an accused has spent in custody and in relation to this facet, the time that an accused has been in custody will have to be seen against the likely sentence that he or she might receive on a retrial.\"\"\""
