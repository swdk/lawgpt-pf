        - examples :"- [2001] UKPC 19: In B (a Child) v R, Lord Bingham of Cornhill emphasized the importance of "an informed and dispassionate assessment of how the interests of justice in the widest sense are best served" and that it is important to maintain "confidence in the efficacy of the criminal justice system." This argument was used to support the view that the interests of justice required a third retrial."
                    "- [2017] 20 HKCFAR 414: In HKSAR v Tam Ho Nam (No 2), the Court of Appeal reiterated that "the interests of justice require all relevant factors, both for and against a retrial, to be taken into account" and that "such factors will not only vary from case to case, but their relative importance and weight will also be different in any given case." This argument was used to support the view that the Court of Appeal should re-exercise the discretion to order a retrial, taking into account all relevant factors."
                    "- [2018] 21 HKCFAR 35: In Secretary for Justice v Wong Chi Fung, the Court of Appeal held that "as a general principle, the relative weight which the Court of Appeal ‘ascribes to each relevant factor’ is a matter within its discretion and it is not open to the Court of Final Appeal to seek to ascribe a different weight." This argument was used to support the view that this Court should not interfere with the Court of Appeal’s exercise of discretion in determining the weight to be given to each relevant factor."
