**Case Nature**
- Appeal

**Appeal Type**
- Legal Error Appeals (erroneous jury direction by the trial judge on the factual issue of loss of self-control in the context of the defense of provocation)

**Newton hearing**
- N/A

**Evidences**
- **Prosecution**: N/A
- **Defense**:
  - Psychiatric evidence: 
    - Dr Wong Chung Kwong, for the defense, diagnosed the appellant with an abnormality of the mind due to major depressive disorder and acute dissociative reactions to stressful events, which significantly impaired his mental capacity and ability to control his emotions and behavior.
    - Dr Oliver Chan, for the prosecution, disagreed with Dr Wong's findings, opining that the appellant had suffered from an adjustment disorder, which did not substantially impair his mental responsibility for his actions and could not provide a causal explanation for the killing.

**Prosecution Case**
- The prosecution presented evidence that the appellant killed the deceased by chopping her with a knife approximately 213 times.

**Defence Case**
- The appellant denied the charge of murder but was prepared to plead guilty to manslaughter by reason of provocation and diminished responsibility.
- The defense case on provocation was based on:
  - Video records of interviews with the appellant by the police shortly after the killing, in which he claimed that the deceased was having an affair and taunted him about becoming a garbage collector, his poor performance as a sexual partner, and that he was not his daughter's father.
  - Appellant's testimony at trial, in which he claimed that after receiving a phone call from the deceased's ex-husband about the appellant's erratic behavior, the deceased thrust a used condom into his face twice near his mouth and told him to eat it to stop asking about her new boyfriend, causing him to lose control and kill her in a frenzied state.
- The defense of diminished responsibility was supported by psychiatric evidence from Dr Wong.

**Defendant's Plea**
- Not guilty to murder, willing to plead guilty to manslaughter.

**Reasoning of Judgement**
- The CFA held that the trial judge misdirected the jury by failing to draw their attention to the psychiatric evidence and its relevance in assessing whether the appellant had lost or might have lost control, thereby depriving the defense of provocation from being fully and fairly presented to the jury.
- The majority of the Court of Appeal (Zervos JA and Macrae VP) considered the psychiatric evidence "highly relevant" to the factual issue of loss of self-control and concluded that the trial judge's failure to direct the jury on this aspect resulted in the defense of provocation not being fully and fairly placed before the jury, warranting a third retrial.
- However, McWalters JA dissented, arguing that enough was enough, given the appellant had already served 11 years in custody and undergone three trials and multiple appeals, and that continuing the prosecution would be oppressive and a violation of his right to be tried without undue delay.

**Sentencing guidelines**
- N/A

**Sentencing / Disposition**
- Upon quashing the order for a third retrial, the CFA entered a conviction for manslaughter on the basis of provocation and sentenced the appellant to time served, allowing for his immediate release from custody.

**Point of Dispute**
- Whether the trial judge's failure to direct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the factual issue of loss of self-control amounted to a miscarriage of justice warranting a third retrial.

**Summary**
- The appellant was convicted of murdering his cohabitee after three trials and appeals.
- The third conviction was quashed due to a misdirection by the trial judge on the defense of provocation, specifically the failure to address the relevance of psychiatric evidence on the issue of loss of self-control.
- A majority of the Court of Appeal ordered a third retrial, while a dissenting judge favored entering a manslaughter conviction based on the existing evidence and time served.
- The CFA allowed the appeal, quashing the order for a third retrial and entering a manslaughter conviction, considering that continuing the prosecution would be oppressive and a violation of the appellant's right to a fair trial without undue delay.

**Case usefulness for future references**
- This case highlights the importance of accurate and comprehensive jury directions, particularly in cases involving complex defenses such as provocation and diminished responsibility, where expert evidence is crucial.
- It also emphasizes the court's discretion in ordering retrials, balancing the interests of justice, including the defendant's right to a fair trial and protection against oppression, with the public interest in resolving serious crimes.

**References**

- **Argument 1: Whether the trial judge's failure to direct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the factual issue of loss of self-control amounted to a miscarriage of justice warranting a third retrial.**
  - **In favor of a third retrial**:
    - HKSAR v Zhou Limei (No 2) (2020) 23 HKCFAR 169, [9]: "This Court would have to be persuaded by cogent and compelling reasons to make such an order. This is consistent with the interests of justice, but of course all relevant factors must be carefully weighed in this exercise of discretion."
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "The trial process on each occasion was flawed. On the facts and evidence before us, I would say that the defence of provocation, which is supported by the appellant’s story (which to some extent is corroborated by the deceased’s former husband’s evidence), the circumstances under which the killing took place and the psychiatric evidence, is at least reasonably arguable and a murder verdict is certainly not a foregone conclusion."
  - **Against a third retrial**:
    - Mok Kin Kau v HKSAR (2008) 11 HKCFAR 1, [12] and [14]: "the ordering of a second retrial after two concluded trials and appeals, and the serving of the whole sentence, was said to be an ‘unusual course’ and in such a situation, in the absence of a special or compelling reason, this was a ‘departure from accepted norms’ sufficient to constitute a substantial and grave injustice."
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "Regrettably, the reality in the present case is that the criminal justice system, despite three attempts, has failed not only the deceased’s family and the public, but also the appellant. I think we have reached a point where enough is enough, and the interests of justice are no longer served by continuing with the prosecution of the appellant for murder."


- **Argument 2: The weight to be given to the conduct of the appellant's legal representatives in the previous trials when considering whether to order a retrial.**
  - **Conduct of defense counsel was a factor to be considered**:
    - HKSAR v Zhou Limei (No 2) (2020) 23 HKCFAR 169, [9]: "Such factors will not only vary from case to case, but their relative importance and weight will also be different in any given case."
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "As explained in Zhou Limei (No 2) [reference: [10]], this Court would only intervene in the exercise of discretion by the Court of Appeal in the determination whether or not to order a retrial unless there has been a serious error of law or principle or approach, such as where the court below has failed to take into account a relevant consideration or has taken into account an irrelevant one."
  - **Conduct of defense counsel should not be attributed to the defendant**:
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "It is difficult to see how and why the appellant should be held responsible for its late raising by his legal representatives given the highly technical nature of the defence."
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "Even if Mr Bruce were really guilty of deliberately withholding the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the question of loss of self‑control from the judge (and the jury), the extent to which the appellant should be held vicariously responsible for it would still be highly debatable, particularly when there was nothing to suggest that the appellant was a party to whatever tactical decision that leading counsel might have made on his behalf."





    -----------------
    

    **Background of the case**
- The appellant was tried and convicted three times for murdering his cohabitee on September 12, 2009.
- In each instance, the conviction was quashed on appeal – twice by the Court of Appeal and once by the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) – and a retrial was ordered.
- This present appeal arose out of the appellant’s last conviction for murder on 26th April 2018.
**Pertinent Law and Charges**
- Section 4 of the Homicide Ordinance (Cap 339):
“Where on a charge of murder there is evidence on which the jury can find that the person charged was provoked (whether by things done or by things said or by both together) to lose his self-control, the question whether the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man do as he did shall be left to be determined by the jury; and in determining that question the jury shall take into account everything both done and said according to the effect which, in their opinion, it would have on a reasonable man.”

**Evidences**
**Prosecution:**
- Video records of interview made by the police shortly after the killing.
- The appellant’s own evidence at trial.
- Evidence that used condoms were found by the appellant in the rubbish bin at the rear staircase outside the flat, and that on the last time that happened, the appellant confronted the deceased with a used condom which he found in the rubbish bin.
- Evidence that a telephone call was made by the deceased’s ex-husband to the deceased on his mobile at 5:40 am on the day of the murder, and that the deceased told him that the appellant had gone crazy, taken off all his clothing and attempted to jump off the building, and she was scared.
- Evidence that, after that telephone call, the deceased twice thrust the used condom into his face near his mouth, asking him to eat it so that he would stop asking her about her new boyfriend.
**Defense:**
- Evidence that the appellant killed the deceased on September 12, 2009, in the flat where they cohabited and that he had done so by chopping her with a knife approximately 213 times.
- Evidence that the appellant was not sure at the time whether the deceased was having an affair with another man, but he had a strong suspicion about the deceased’s infidelity.
- Evidence that the appellant lost control and his mind went blank.
- Psychiatric evidence that the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of the mind arising from the combined effects of two psychiatric disorders, namely, a Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) of mild to moderate severity, and Acute Dissociative Reactions to Stressful Events (“ADR”) which was a brief, acute and serious disorder, coupled with four underlying factors, namely, hypoglycaemia, sleep deprivation, alcohol and emotional memory of his ex-wife’s adultery.
**Prosecution Case**
- The prosecution argued that the appellant intended to kill the deceased, and that he was not provoked into killing her.
**Defence Case**
- The defense argued that the appellant was provoked into killing the deceased by reason of her infidelity and her taunting of him about becoming a garbage collector, his poor performance as a sexual partner, and that he was not his daughter’s father and she had been fathered by a man who had an affair with his ex-wife.
- The defense also argued that the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of the mind at the time of the killing due to psychiatric disorders and underlying factors, which substantially impaired his responsibility for his act.
**Defendant's Plea**
- The appellant pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of provocation, which was not accepted by the prosecution.
**Reasoning of Judgement**

- The Court of Appeal held that this misdirection resulted in the defense of provocation not being fully and fairly placed before the jury.
- The Court of Appeal also found that the trial judge erred in not giving appropriate directions to the jury on the issue of whether the appellant had lost his self-control, and that this error contributed to the jury’s verdict of guilty of murder.
- The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction for murder.
- The majority of the Court of Appeal held that a third retrial should be ordered, but the dissenting judge held that enough was enough and the appellant should not be subjected to a further retrial.
- The CFA granted leave to appeal on the substantial and grave injustice basis on the footing that it was reasonably arguable that in ordering a third retrial for murder, the exercise of discretion by the majority of the Court of Appeal miscarried.
- The CFA held that the majority of the Court of Appeal had erred in taking into account irrelevant considerations when exercising the discretion to order a third retrial, including the conduct of the appellant’s legal representatives at trial and the fact that diminished responsibility was only raised for the first time at the third trial.
- The CFA held that the interests of justice did not require a third retrial, and that the appellant should be convicted of manslaughter on the basis of provocation and sentenced accordingly.

The strength of the prosecution case is also a relevant consideration."
