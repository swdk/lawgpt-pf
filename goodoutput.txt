**Case Nature**
- Appeal

**Appeal Type**
- Legal Error Appeals (erroneous jury direction by the trial judge on the factual issue of loss of self-control in the context of the defense of provocation)

**Newton hearing**
- N/A

**Evidences**
- **Prosecution**: N/A
- **Defense**:
  - Psychiatric evidence: 
    - Dr Wong Chung Kwong, for the defense, diagnosed the appellant with an abnormality of the mind due to major depressive disorder and acute dissociative reactions to stressful events, which significantly impaired his mental capacity and ability to control his emotions and behavior.
    - Dr Oliver Chan, for the prosecution, disagreed with Dr Wong's findings, opining that the appellant had suffered from an adjustment disorder, which did not substantially impair his mental responsibility for his actions and could not provide a causal explanation for the killing.

**Prosecution Case**
- The prosecution presented evidence that the appellant killed the deceased by chopping her with a knife approximately 213 times.

**Defence Case**
- The appellant denied the charge of murder but was prepared to plead guilty to manslaughter by reason of provocation and diminished responsibility.
- The defense case on provocation was based on:
  - Video records of interviews with the appellant by the police shortly after the killing, in which he claimed that the deceased was having an affair and taunted him about becoming a garbage collector, his poor performance as a sexual partner, and that he was not his daughter's father.
  - Appellant's testimony at trial, in which he claimed that after receiving a phone call from the deceased's ex-husband about the appellant's erratic behavior, the deceased thrust a used condom into his face twice near his mouth and told him to eat it to stop asking about her new boyfriend, causing him to lose control and kill her in a frenzied state.
- The defense of diminished responsibility was supported by psychiatric evidence from Dr Wong.

**Defendant's Plea**
- Not guilty to murder, willing to plead guilty to manslaughter.

**Reasoning of Judgement**
- The CFA held that the trial judge misdirected the jury by failing to draw their attention to the psychiatric evidence and its relevance in assessing whether the appellant had lost or might have lost control, thereby depriving the defense of provocation from being fully and fairly presented to the jury.
- The majority of the Court of Appeal (Zervos JA and Macrae VP) considered the psychiatric evidence "highly relevant" to the factual issue of loss of self-control and concluded that the trial judge's failure to direct the jury on this aspect resulted in the defense of provocation not being fully and fairly placed before the jury, warranting a third retrial.
- However, McWalters JA dissented, arguing that enough was enough, given the appellant had already served 11 years in custody and undergone three trials and multiple appeals, and that continuing the prosecution would be oppressive and a violation of his right to be tried without undue delay.

**Sentencing guidelines**
- N/A

**Sentencing / Disposition**
- Upon quashing the order for a third retrial, the CFA entered a conviction for manslaughter on the basis of provocation and sentenced the appellant to time served, allowing for his immediate release from custody.

**Point of Dispute**
- Whether the trial judge's failure to direct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the factual issue of loss of self-control amounted to a miscarriage of justice warranting a third retrial.

**Summary**
- The appellant was convicted of murdering his cohabitee after three trials and appeals.
- The third conviction was quashed due to a misdirection by the trial judge on the defense of provocation, specifically the failure to address the relevance of psychiatric evidence on the issue of loss of self-control.
- A majority of the Court of Appeal ordered a third retrial, while a dissenting judge favored entering a manslaughter conviction based on the existing evidence and time served.
- The CFA allowed the appeal, quashing the order for a third retrial and entering a manslaughter conviction, considering that continuing the prosecution would be oppressive and a violation of the appellant's right to a fair trial without undue delay.

**Case usefulness for future references**
- This case highlights the importance of accurate and comprehensive jury directions, particularly in cases involving complex defenses such as provocation and diminished responsibility, where expert evidence is crucial.
- It also emphasizes the court's discretion in ordering retrials, balancing the interests of justice, including the defendant's right to a fair trial and protection against oppression, with the public interest in resolving serious crimes.

**References**

- **Argument 1: Whether the trial judge's failure to direct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the factual issue of loss of self-control amounted to a miscarriage of justice warranting a third retrial.**
  - **In favor of a third retrial**:
    - HKSAR v Zhou Limei (No 2) (2020) 23 HKCFAR 169, [9]: "This Court would have to be persuaded by cogent and compelling reasons to make such an order. This is consistent with the interests of justice, but of course all relevant factors must be carefully weighed in this exercise of discretion."
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "The trial process on each occasion was flawed. On the facts and evidence before us, I would say that the defence of provocation, which is supported by the appellant’s story (which to some extent is corroborated by the deceased’s former husband’s evidence), the circumstances under which the killing took place and the psychiatric evidence, is at least reasonably arguable and a murder verdict is certainly not a foregone conclusion."
  - **Against a third retrial**:
    - Mok Kin Kau v HKSAR (2008) 11 HKCFAR 1, [12] and [14]: "the ordering of a second retrial after two concluded trials and appeals, and the serving of the whole sentence, was said to be an ‘unusual course’ and in such a situation, in the absence of a special or compelling reason, this was a ‘departure from accepted norms’ sufficient to constitute a substantial and grave injustice."
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "Regrettably, the reality in the present case is that the criminal justice system, despite three attempts, has failed not only the deceased’s family and the public, but also the appellant. I think we have reached a point where enough is enough, and the interests of justice are no longer served by continuing with the prosecution of the appellant for murder."


- **Argument 2: The weight to be given to the conduct of the appellant's legal representatives in the previous trials when considering whether to order a retrial.**
  - **Conduct of defense counsel was a factor to be considered**:
    - HKSAR v Zhou Limei (No 2) (2020) 23 HKCFAR 169, [9]: "Such factors will not only vary from case to case, but their relative importance and weight will also be different in any given case."
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "As explained in Zhou Limei (No 2) [reference: [10]], this Court would only intervene in the exercise of discretion by the Court of Appeal in the determination whether or not to order a retrial unless there has been a serious error of law or principle or approach, such as where the court below has failed to take into account a relevant consideration or has taken into account an irrelevant one."
  - **Conduct of defense counsel should not be attributed to the defendant**:
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "It is difficult to see how and why the appellant should be held responsible for its late raising by his legal representatives given the highly technical nature of the defence."
    - HKSAR v Liang Yaoqiang (current case): "Even if Mr Bruce were really guilty of deliberately withholding the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the question of loss of self‑control from the judge (and the jury), the extent to which the appellant should be held vicariously responsible for it would still be highly debatable, particularly when there was nothing to suggest that the appellant was a party to whatever tactical decision that leading counsel might have made on his behalf."

**Pertinent Law and Charges**
- Section 4 of the Homicide Ordinance (Cap 339):
“Where on a charge of murder there is evidence on which the jury can find that the person charged was provoked (whether by things done or by things said or by both together) to lose his self-control, the question whether the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man do as he did shall be left to be determined by the jury; and in determining that question the jury shall take into account everything both done and said according to the effect which, in their opinion, it would have on a reasonable man.”

**Prosecution:**
- Video records of interview made by the police shortly after the killing.
- The appellant’s own evidence at trial.
- Evidence that used condoms were found by the appellant in the rubbish bin at the rear staircase outside the flat, and that on the last time that happened, the appellant confronted the deceased with a used condom which he found in the rubbish bin.
- Evidence that a telephone call was made by the deceased’s ex-husband to the deceased on his mobile at 5:40 am on the day of the murder, and that the deceased told him that the appellant had gone crazy, taken off all his clothing and attempted to jump off the building, and she was scared.
- Evidence that, after that telephone call, the deceased twice thrust the used condom into his face near his mouth, asking him to eat it so that he would stop asking her about her new boyfriend.
**Defense:**
- Evidence that the appellant killed the deceased on September 12, 2009, in the flat where they cohabited and that he had done so by chopping her with a knife approximately 213 times.
- Evidence that the appellant was not sure at the time whether the deceased was having an affair with another man, but he had a strong suspicion about the deceased’s infidelity.
- Evidence that the appellant lost control and his mind went blank.
- Psychiatric evidence that the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of the mind arising from the combined effects of two psychiatric disorders, namely, a Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) of mild to moderate severity, and Acute Dissociative Reactions to Stressful Events (“ADR”) which was a brief, acute and serious disorder, coupled with four underlying factors, namely, hypoglycaemia, sleep deprivation, alcohol and emotional memory of his ex-wife’s adultery.
**Prosecution Case**
- The prosecution argued that the appellant intended to kill the deceased, and that he was not provoked into killing her.
**Defence Case**
- The defense argued that the appellant was provoked into killing the deceased by reason of her infidelity and her taunting of him about becoming a garbage collector, his poor performance as a sexual partner, and that he was not his daughter’s father and she had been fathered by a man who had an affair with his ex-wife.
- The defense also argued that the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of the mind at the time of the killing due to psychiatric disorders and underlying factors, which substantially impaired his responsibility for his act.

- The Court of Appeal held that this misdirection resulted in the defense of provocation not being fully and fairly placed before the jury.
- The Court of Appeal also found that the trial judge erred in not giving appropriate directions to the jury on the issue of whether the appellant had lost his self-control, and that this error contributed to the jury’s verdict of guilty of murder.
- The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction for murder.
- The majority of the Court of Appeal held that a third retrial should be ordered, but the dissenting judge held that enough was enough and the appellant should not be subjected to a further retrial.
- The CFA granted leave to appeal on the substantial and grave injustice basis on the footing that it was reasonably arguable that in ordering a third retrial for murder, the exercise of discretion by the majority of the Court of Appeal miscarried.
- The CFA held that the majority of the Court of Appeal had erred in taking into account irrelevant considerations when exercising the discretion to order a third retrial, including the conduct of the appellant’s legal representatives at trial and the fact that diminished responsibility was only raised for the first time at the third trial.
- The CFA held that the interests of justice did not require a third retrial, and that the appellant should be convicted of manslaughter on the basis of provocation and sentenced accordingly.
**Sentencing guidelines**

----------

**Background of the case**

The appellant, Mr. Liang Yaoqiang, was convicted of murdering his cohabitee, Ms. Yeung Sau Yu, on September 12, 2009. He was convicted three times by different juries, but each conviction was overturned on appeal.

- First Trial: In October 2010, the appellant was convicted of murder by a unanimous jury verdict.
- First Appeal: In November 2013, the Court of Appeal allowed the appellant's appeal and quashed the conviction due to the introduction of inadmissible hearsay evidence.
- Second Trial: In March 2014, the appellant was again convicted of murder by a unanimous jury verdict.
- Second Appeal: In June 2015, the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, with a majority decision rejecting the appellant's application for leave to appeal.
- Third Trial: In April 2018, the appellant faced a third trial, this time with the addition of a defense of diminished responsibility supported by psychiatric evidence.
- Third Appeal: In November 2020, the Court of Appeal unanimously quashed the conviction and ordered a third retrial, citing a misdirection by the trial judge in failing to draw the jury's attention to the psychiatric evidence and its relevance to the issue of loss of self-control. 

**Pertinent Laws**

N/A

**Evidences**

Prosecution:

- The prosecution presented physical evidence, including the murder weapon and forensic analysis of the crime scene.
- Video records of interviews conducted with the appellant shortly after the incident, in which he admitted to killing the deceased.
- Testimony from witnesses who heard or saw the events leading up to and including the murder.

Defense:

- The appellant presented a defense of provocation, arguing that the deceased had been having an affair and had taunted and provoked him leading up to the incident.
- Psychiatric evidence was introduced to support the defense of diminished responsibility, suggesting that the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing.

**Prosecution Case**

The prosecution argued that the appellant had intentionally and unlawfully killed the deceased, and that there was no evidence to support a defense of provocation or diminished responsibility.

**Defence Case**

The defense argued that the appellant had been provoked by the deceased's actions and that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing, which should be considered as mitigating factors.

**Defendant's Plea**

The appellant pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted manslaughter on the basis of provocation.

**Reasoning of Judgement**

The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred in failing to direct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the issue of loss of self-control under the defense of provocation. The court found that this misdirection had resulted in the defense of provocation not being fully and fairly placed before the jury, thereby depriving the appellant of a fair trial.

**Guidelines**

The court considered the principles governing the exercise of discretion to order a retrial, including the interests of justice, the strength of the prosecution case, and the potential impact on the appellant.

**Disposition**

The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction. The court further ordered a third retrial for the appellant.

**Point of Dispute**

The main point of dispute in this case was whether the trial judge's failure to direct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the issue of loss of self-control amounted to a misdirection that deprived the appellant of a fair trial.

**Summary**

The appellant, Mr. Liang Yaoqiang, was convicted of murdering his cohabitee, Ms. Yeung Sau Yu, on September 12, 2009. The conviction went through three trials and appeals, with each higher court quashing the previous conviction due to errors in the proceedings. The case involved issues of evidence admissibility, jury instructions, and the consideration of psychiatric evidence in the defense of diminished responsibility. The Court of Appeal ultimately found that the trial judge's failure to properly instruct the jury on the relevance of psychiatric evidence to the defense of provocation constituted a misdirection that resulted in an unfair trial. The court ordered a third retrial for the appellant, balancing the interests of justice and the need to provide a fair trial with the appellant's rights and circumstances.

**Principles established**

- The trial judge has a duty to properly instruct the jury on all relevant aspects of the law and evidence in a criminal trial.
- The defense of provocation must be fully and fairly presented to the jury, including consideration of relevant evidence that may support the defense.
- The court has the discretion to order a retrial in the interests of justice, taking into account factors such as the strength of the prosecution case, the impact on the appellant, and the need for finality in the proceedings.

**Factors considered**

- The nature of the trial judge's error in failing to direct the jury on the relevance of the psychiatric evidence to the defense of provocation.
- The potential impact of this error on the jury's verdict.
- The strength of the prosecution case against the appellant.
- The appellant's rights to a fair trial and to be free from oppressive or vexatious proceedings.
- The interests of justice in ensuring that the murder charge against the appellant is ultimately resolved by a jury verdict.

**How this case will be useful for future references**
